The *SustainML Framework* aims to provide an energy optimized hardware solution and the corresponding ML model for solving a desired
machine learning problem formulated by the user, considering the carbon footprint it would take to train the resulting model.

Within the *SustainML Architecture*, a ``Node`` refers to each one of the software modules that performs
a particular task, conforms a single executable unit and can be locally or remotely deployed.
This decoupling and modularity can be achieved thanks to the underlying `eProsima Fast DDS middleware <https://www.eprosima.com/index.php/products-all/eprosima-fast-dds>`_.

In the architecture, the ``Front-End`` acts as the interface between the user and the *SustainML Framework*.
The Front-End is responsible for collecting the user requirements and constraints, sending them to the Back-End and give feedback of the intermediate and final results when available:

* :ref:`frontend`

The ``Back-End`` is composed of two main entities:

* The :ref:`orchestrator` that controls the execution of the task and nourishes data to the Front-End.
* The :ref:`module_nodes` that specialize in particular tasks of the solution.

And the different ``Module Nodes`` that specializes in a particular task of the solution:

* :ref:`appreqs_node`
* :ref:`carbontracker_node`
* :ref:`hwconstraints_node`
* :ref:`mlmodelmetadata_node`
* :ref:`mlmodelprovider_node`
* :ref:`hwprovider_node`

Node Configuration Service
--------------------------

.. image:: ../../figures/SustainML-Framework-Service_design.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 75%

This service enables **real-time, dynamic configuration and information request** of any module node in the system.
The orchestrator exposes a **synchronous RPC** over DDS, sending and receiving **JSON** strings that:

- **node_id**: identifies the target node
- **transaction_id**: tracks each requestâ€“response pair
- **configuration**: carries the new or current settings

On success, the response returns the updated configuration; on failure, an error code and message are provided.
